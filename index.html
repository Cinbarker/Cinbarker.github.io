						<div class="text-box">
							<p>As the printer ink stains on my childhood room rug show, I was taking apart electronics
								long before I had any clue how they worked. Fast-forward ten years, and I'm working my
								way through an Electrical Engineering degree, with dozens of projects under my belt.
								After having gained some experience in both industry and academia, I can tell that this
								field is exactly what I want to work in.</p>
							<p>While growing up people tell you that powerful politicians, personalities, and wealthy people
								run the world. That isn't how I see it. From trains to telegraphs and now transistors, throughout history
								the most impactful changes - the paradigm shifts - were always sparked by technological
								advances. I want to work where the real changes are made.</p>
							<p>I love to learn. I am never more comfortable than when tackling a new problem in the
								safety of my bedroom electronics lab. Equally, I love to teach. My favorite part about
								teaching electronics is that as people begin to learn more about them, they slowly realize
								how unfathomably impressive and - for lack of a better word - just plain cool the field is.</p>
							<p>My ultimate goal is to become a professional engineer, creating innovative technologies that
								future generations can inherit, laugh at, and improve upon, one project at a time.</p>

									<li>Started a project to make an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Cinbarker/OpenTurret" class="link">open source pan tilt mechanism</a>
										that could be used for a variety of applications.</li>
									<li>Designed the first versions of the mechanical and electrical systems, producing
										initial prototypes that got the project up and running.</li>
									<li>As the project grew, I learned quite a bit about application interface design
										using the Qt5 package from Computer Scientists who joined the project. </li>

									<li>This is my take on a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Cinbarker/MicroFTDI" class="link">tiny modern USB to UART converter</a>.</li>
									<li>The FTDI converter is an essential tool for any embedded developer, and I did not
										like the available options, so I made my own USB-C one. Now I make sure to always
										have a handful of them scattered around my backpack.</li>
									<li>This was a good exercise in trying to fit a device into the smallest possible form
										factor without compromising performance, something that I like to do with projects
										as much as possible.</li>
