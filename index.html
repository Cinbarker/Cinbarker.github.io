                        <p>I was always one of those kids who took things apart – printers, computers, you name it.
                            Fast-forward a decade, and I'm working my way through a Computer & Embedded Systems
                            degree, with dozens of projects under my belt. After having gained some experience in both
                            industry and academia, I can tell that this is exactly the field I want to work in.</p>
                        <p>I believe real change comes from technology, not politics. From trains to telegraphs and
                            now transistors, throughout history the most impactful changes - the paradigm shifts - were
                            always sparked by technological advances. I want to work where the real changes are made.</p>
                        <p>I love learning by doing, especially from the safety of my homemade electronics lab.
                            Equally, I love to teach. My favorite part about teaching electronics is that as people begin to
                            learn more about them, they slowly realize how unfathomably impressive and - for lack of a
                            better word - just plain cool the tech really is.</p>
                        <p>My ultimate goal is to become a professional embedded systems engineer, creating innovative
                            technologies that future generations can inherit, laugh at, and improve upon, one project at a time.</p>
