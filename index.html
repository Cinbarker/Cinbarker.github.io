						<div class="text-box">
							<p>As the printer ink stains on my childhood room rug show, I was taking apart electronics
								long before I had any clue how they worked. Fast-forward ten years, and I'm working my
								way through a Computer & Embedded Systems degree, with dozens of projects under my belt.
								After having gained some experience in both industry and academia, I can tell that this
								is exactly the field I want to work in.</p>
							<p>Some say that politicians, personalities, and the wealthy have all the power. That
								isn't how I see it. From trains to telegraphs and now transistors, throughout history
								the most impactful changes - the paradigm shifts - were always sparked by technological
								advances. I want to work where the real changes are made.</p>
							<p>I love to learn. I am never more comfortable than when tackling a new problem in the
								safety of my homemade electronics lab. Equally, I love to teach. My favorite part about
								teaching electronics is that as people begin to learn more about them, they slowly realize
								how unfathomably impressive and - for lack of a better word - just plain cool the field really is.</p>
							<p>My ultimate goal is to become a professional embedded systems engineer, creating innovative technologies that
								future generations can inherit, laugh at, and improve upon, one project at a time.</p>
